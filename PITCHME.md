### I should remember this when I think I haven't got anything to blog about

---

# Marketing 2.0

### "Relevancy or die!"

* All about connection
* Nobody succeeds by selling alone
* Authentic experiences and people, and part of customer journey
* Meaningful relationships

---

# Basically...

Blogging, social media, talks and presentations, meetups, GitHub topics etc.

---

## Facebook is a dead-zone, but Twitter and Mastodon are lively for APIs.
